  Default Tomcat context.xml file for the SSO server.
  
  Specifies the environment properties for the application. These can 
  be overridden after deployment to a Tomcat container by updating the 
  context copied to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/ROOT.xml
  
  Note: If a ROOT.xml file already exists in the Tomcat conf path above,
  Tomcat will not overwrite it with this file.
